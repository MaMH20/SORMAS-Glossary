# **TASKS MANAGEMENT DIRECTORY**

Surveillance activities and outbreak responses often rely on the coordination of multidisciplinary teams. A broad classification of personas or user roles in an outbreak response include: hospital informants, surveillance officers, surveillance supervisors (state epidemiologist) contact officers, contact supervisors, case officers, laboratory officers, just to name a few. The task module allows realtime assignment and management of tasks among the different personas which then improves and enhances the overall efficiency of the outbreak response. The classification or context of a task can be general or associated to an entity (case, contact, event). 

## Tasks Glossary

### Task Entity

1.	**Associated link:** It directs the user to the cases, contacts, or events for which a task is assigned.
2.	**Task context:** This represents the entity (case, contact, event) or general aspects of response to which the task is associated.
3.	**Task type:** This represents the category of the task and includes: case investigation, case isolation, case management, contact investigation, contact follow-up, sample collection, sample transportation, sample testing, report generation, event investigation etc.
4.	**Associated case/contact/event:** The name of the entity (case, contact, event) that the task is related to.
7.	**Suggested start:** The recommended date by which a newly assigned task should start.
8.	**Due date:** The date by which an assigned task should be completed. 
9.	**Task priority:** An indication of the urgency with which a task should be executed (high, normal, low).
10.	**Comments on tasks:** Any users’ general comments to the specific task.
11.	**Comments on execution:**  Any users’ comments on the execution of the task, e.g. updates, challenges encountered, request for clarification etc.
12.	**Task status:** The state of the task. It could be any of the following:

	a.	Pending: Tasks awaiting execution

	b.	Done: Completed tasks

	c.	Removed: Tasks taken out of the system because they were discarded

	d.	Not executable: Tasks that are not possible to carry out

13. **Assigned to:** The name of the user responsible for executing the given task.

### Task Management Directory 

1.	**Basic export:** To download the task management directory with the associated variables as displayed on the default page. 
2.	**Enter bulk edit mode:** Once activated, this function allows the selection of several tasks and execute a single action (deletion) on all of them at once.
3.	**New task:**  To create a new task.
4.	**Region:** The responsible region of the entity (case, contact, event,) that the task is related to.
5.	**District:** The responsible district of the entity (case, contact, event) that the task is related to.
6.	**Created by:** The name of the user who created the task.
7.	**By Date or By epi week:** The time unit used to filter the task management directory. Possible options are: “by date” or “by epidemiological week”.
8.	**Task reference date:** The date type used to filter the task directory. It can be either the suggested start date, or the suggested due date.
9.	**Task from epi week… and, Task to epi week… :** These two filters jointly select and display tasks by a desired period in epidemiological weeks. Activating the “By epi week” filter setting is a prerequisite for using these filters.
10.	**Officer tasks:** This filters the task directory for all tasks assigned to surveillance officers. 
11.	**My task:** This filters the task directory for all tasks assigned to the logged in user.
12.	**All tasks:** All created tasks in SORMAS irrespective of the user role or persona that the task is assigned to. 
13.	**Active tasks:** Tasks that the system loads by default each time a user opens the tasks directory. 
14.	**Archived tasks:** Tasks that are removed from the default view. Archiving a task only prevent the task from being loaded by default in order to improve performance of the system. This similar logic applies to all directories in SORMAS.
