# Welcome

This glossary contains the nomenclature and definitions of the SORMAS entities and attributes (data elements). It seeks to provide a common understanding and interpretation of the data collected in SORMAS among the different countries, organizations and users.

This glossary is a living document insofar as SORMAS retains its versatility of adopting to changing demands of disease surveillance and outbreak management. It is worth noting that, this document was based on the generic design of SORMAS and may not reflect all the country-specific adoptions currently in use.

For ease of reference, we used the same structure of the directories in the SORMAS application to organize this glossary. Each section of the glossary begin with a brief overview of the epidemiological principles pertained to the entity in question, then followed by the nomenclature of each of its attributes.
