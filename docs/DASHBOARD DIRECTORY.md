# **DASHBOARD DIRECTORY**

## **Brief Notes**

Epidemiological dashboards are digital innovations for real-time visualization of multiple streams of related data for purposes of surveillance and outbreak management. By these attributes, dashboards facilitate informed decision making using multiple combinations of indicators and figures obtained from data analyses. In this way,  dashboards improve situational awareness - especially for ongoing outbreak responses. Aside providing visuals for speedy situational assessment, epidemiological  dashboards reduce information floods that may result from multiple sources of data, and minimize workflow interruptions â€“ e.g. by having to manually perform periodic analyses of incoming data.

## **Overview of Dashboard Directory on SORMAS**

The  SORMAS dashboard has two sections viz. surveillance and contacts; each displayed at a time. These are represented by tabs on the upper right corner of the screen. There are multiple filters for selecting variables of interest e.g. disease, time, etc.
Surveillance Dashboard
The Surveillance dashboard has two sections. The upper section displays summary information of case  counts of each infectious disease for specified time interval of notification. This is accompanied by  graphical display of the difference in number of cases between any two specified time intervals. The lower section displays an epidemiological curve, case status map and indicators for each disease; one at a time. The dashboard has  filters for displaying information of specified diseases, times, and places.
Contact Dashboard
The contact dashboard displays summary information of individuals reported to have come into contact with probable or confirmed cases of  infectious diseases. For a selected disease of interest, the types of contact information displayed include: number of contacts, follow-up status chart and spatial distribution  of contacts.


## Dashboard Glossary 

### Surveillance Dashboard

1. **New cases:** The number of  reported cases  classified by case classification status (confirmed, probable, suspected, not a case, not yet classified)
2. **Last report district:** The name of the district or local government area that reported the most recent case of a specified disease. 
3. **Fatalities:**  The number of cases that   died from the specified disease. 
4. **New events:** The numbers of events  classified by event status (signal, events, screening, cluster) 
5. **Outbreak notification:** Each epidemic prone disease has a predetermined number of case (outbreak threshold) beyond which an outbreak of the disease in question is said to occur.  A red flag is automatically displayed on the tab of the disease in question when this outbreak threshold is exceeded.  This outbreak notification is per disease, region and district.
6. **Test results:** The outcome of laboratory investigation of samples (positive, negative, pending, indeterminate).
7. **Epidemiological curve (epidemic curve or epic curve):** This a  histogram  of the number of cases of a specified disease by the date of illness onset. An epidemiological curve shows the progression and magnitude of the disease in the population.
8. **Grouping (on epidemiological curve):** This is the unit of time used to scale the horizontal axis of the epidemic curve.  The possible options are: days, weeks, and months. 
9. **Grouping (of cases on epidemiological curve):** This is used to group the cases by case classification (not yet classified, confirmed, probable, suspected).
10. **Case status map:** This is an interactive map that shows the spatial distribution  of cases, contacts, events, and their related variables.
11. **Map layers:** This is an interactive function on the case status map that allows for the visualization of cases, contacts, events, etc. by various characteristics of interest viz. case classification; reporting levels (facilities, regions, case counts, case incidence proportion),  contacts,  events, or any appropriate combinations and permutations of these.
12. **Map key:** A legend of the  map. 

### Contacts Dashboard

1. **All contacts:** The number of contacts classified by contact classification status (unconfirmed, confirmed, not a contact, new, symptomatic).
2. **Under follow-up:** The number of contacts that are under monitoring (contact follow-up) by a contact tracing team. They are classified by their last follow-up status (cooperative, uncooperative, unavailable)
3. **Stopped follow-up:** The number of contacts which are no longer under follow-up for any of the following reasons: completed follow-up, canceled follow-up, lost to follow-up, or converted to case.
4. **Visits:** The number of   follow-up visits performed classified by visit remark (unavailable, uncooperative, cooperative).
5. **Contacts per case:** The minimum, maximum, and average number of contacts per case. 
6. **Contacts in quarantine:** The number of contacts in quarantine. 
7. **Grouping (of contacts on chart):** This is the unit of time used to scale the horizontal axis of the contact chart.  
   The possible options are: days, epi-weeks, and months. 
8. **Data:** The type of contact data depicted by the contact chart namely: follow-up status, contact classification, and follow-up until.
9. **Follow-up status chart:** A histogram of number of contacts grouped by follow-up status (under follow-up, lost to follow-up, completed follow-up, canceled follow-up, converted to case).
10. **Contact classification chart:**  A histogram of number of contacts grouped by contact classification status (confirmed, unconfirmed, new, not a contact, symptomatic).
11. **Follow-up until chart:** A histogram of number of contacts grouped by their last date of follow up.
