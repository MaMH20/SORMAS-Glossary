# SORMAS-Glossary
This glossary contains the definitions of all the entities and attributes in SORMAS.


# Schemaspy
We use [schemaspy](http://schemaspy.org/) to analyze the SORMAS database. Schemaspy generates a static website 
and provides an easy access to every table and column. ER diagrams are generated by default and various descriptions can
be exported as PDF.
Checkout the [schemaspy](schemaspy/) folder to see how it works.
