## DASHBOARD

### Brief Notes

Epidemiologic dashboards are digital innovations for realtime and periodic concurrent visualization of multiple streams of related data for purposes of surveillance and outbreak management. By these attributes, dashboards facilitate informed decision making using multiple combinations of data sources and analyses. In this way, dashboards improve situational awareness - especially for ongoing oubreak responses. Aside providing visuals for speedy situational assessment, epidemiologic dashboards reduce information floods that may result from multiple sources of data, and minimize workflow interruptions eg. by having to manually perform periodic analyses of incoming data.

**Overview of Dashboard Directory on SORMAS**

The SORMAS dashboard is the default interface/entity on logging onto SORMAS. The SORMAS dashboard has two sections viz. surveillance and contacts; each displayed at a time. These are represented by tabs on the upper right corner of the screen. There are multiple filters for selecting variables of interest eg. disease, time, etc.

***Surveillance Dashboard\***

The Surveillance dashboard has two sections. The first section displays summary information on counts of each infectious disease for specified times or periods. This is accompanied by graphical display of the number of cases (counts) between any two specified times or periods. The second section displays an epidemiological curve accomapnied by a case status map. Both of these have filters for displaying information of speific diseases, times, and places.

***Contact Dashboard\***

The contact dashboard displays summary information of individuals reported to have come into contact with suspected or confirmed cases of an a given infectious disease. For a selceted disease of interest, the types of contact information displayed include: counts of contacts, follow-up status chart per unit time, geographical distribution (interractive map) that is able to reveal more detailed and specific information of contacts.

### Dashboard Glossary

1. **Last report:** The name of the reporting place (district, local government area, etc) that has reported the most recent case of a specified disease (as displayed) at a given point in time.
2. **Fatalities:** Number of cases of a specified disease that have died.
3. **New events:** These are the numbers of most recently identified private or public gatherings of persons for activities which carry the risk of spreading an infectious disease among participants.
4. **New cases:** The number of the most recently reported cases of a specified disease. (NB. new cases may have an earlier onset than earlier reported case).
5. **Outbreak notification:** Each epidemic prone disease has a predetermined number of case (outbreak threshold) beyond which an outbreak of the disease in question is said to occur. In the design of SORMAS, a red flag is automatically displayed on the tab of the disease in question when this outbreak threshold is exceed. This automation facilitate realtime detection of outbreaks.
6. **Test results:** The outcome of laboratory investigation of a specified disease (positive, negative, pending, indeterminate).
7. **Epidemiological curve (epidemic curve or epic curve):** This a plot (histogram/linegraph) of the number of cases of a specified disease by the time of illness onset (***not time of reporting\***). An epidemiological curve shows progression of illnesses in an outbreak over time.
8. **Grouping (on epidemiological curve):** This is the unit of time by which the number of cases are counted and plotted on an epi curve. The possible options in SORMAS are: days, weeks, and months. Regrouping or stratification of cases on an epi curve is also possible by other variables such as: case classification (not yet classified, confirmed, probable, suspected), age, age group, sex, place of ocurrence, type of exposure etc.
9. **Case status (on epidemiological curve):** Cases that contribute the an epi curve may have been diagnosed dead or die some time afterwards. Thus, the status of a case refers to whether or not the case is alive.
10. **Case status map:** This is an interactive map that shows the distribution of cases and their related variables by place of origin.
11. **Map layers:** An interactive function that allows for the visualization of cases by various specific chararcteristics of interest such as: case classification; reporting levels (facilities, districts, regions, countries), associated contacts, associated events, or any appropriate combinations and permutations of these.
12. **Map key:** A legend of the characteristics of cases (layers) that are depicted by a particular case map.
